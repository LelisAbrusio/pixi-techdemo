# TechDemo Assignment

This project is a collection of interactive tech demos built with **React**, **Vite**, and **PIXI.js**. The demos include:

- **TechDemo1:** Card animation demo.
- **TechDemo2:** Dialogue system with gradual text reveal.
- **TechDemo3:** Particle effects demo.

This project is designed to be built and deployed as a web application (hosted on GitHub Pages).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or above is recommended)
- **Git**

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LelisAbrusio/pixi-techdemo.git
cd pixi-techdemo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

This project uses Vite for development. To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server and open the project in your default browser. The server supports hot module reloading so you can see changes in real time.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command runs TypeScript build (tsc -b) and then uses Vite to create a production-ready build in the build folder (or dist if you have configured it differently).

You can access the demo in following link:
